                            <h2>To eat or go to the gym?</h2>
                            <h3>To buy a motorcicle, or to learn computer programming?</h3>

                    <h2> What am i doing with my life?</h2>
                    <p> If you are too young to question that to yourself, please don't read further. It's embarassing to me trying to explain something that only someone passing through a existencial crisis can feel. Its like explaining hemorroids to someone
                        that never had. This website is part of the superation of a dificult fase of a human being that is inexorable to all of us. You will suffer from this, sooner or later!</p>
                    <h2> I developed this website in my thirties! </h2>
                        <p> I believe that the age mentioned is self explaining. It's like saying that i have 15 years old and am in my puberty. If you say that is in your thirties there is no denying that you have a existencial crisis in progress. Don't deny it,
                            this only make the things worse!</p>
        
                    <h1>So what is your purpose? Trow it!</h1>
                        <p> This is a website about programming and tecnology, or at least it was suposed to be. The matter of the fact is that i am a newbie on the subject, because i was a lawyer until my thirties (fuck you existencial crisis), but now i am studying
                            computer science! Don't ask me why, again! </p>
        
                    <h1> Am i losing my time reading all of this? </h1>
                        <p> Probably yes! But since you are in the midle you already losed it, so there isn't any problem if you continue! The only things i will show that has some value are my cat fotografies anyway!</p>

            <aside id="lateral">
                <h1> Who am I? </h1>
            <p> Just call me W.P. I don't like unecessary expositure. Being on a existencial crisis is enough without everybody asking me if i really am suffering of this condition! On the year of 2020, i am 32 years old, have a wife, a cat and a 10 years
                old son. Already was a lawyer, nowadays a legal assistent on the federal prosecutor office, but changing carrear as a man nowadays in his thirties should do! I am from Brazil, but i choose to write in english for practice, since the universal
                tech language seems to be english nowadays. (But i am trying to learn mandarin. We never know the future!)</p>
            <h2> How this website is organized </h2>
            <p> This website is structured in 7 (seven) parts. On 'Tips' i will trow some things i learned that facilitated my life on these few years. On 'Bullshit', i will write some of things about myself, as well as everything that doesn't include in
                the other parts. On 'Hungry' i will post some of the foods i cooked and eated, because i like to eat a lot. On the 'Mental workout', there will be some philosofical theories i liked, even if i didn't understood it well. On 'Programming
                Trials' i will show my progress in the learning of these subject. On 'Tech Revolution' i will comment about technology and the impacts of the upcoming changes. The most important part of my website are my Cat's Fotos, wich serve as the
                click bait.</p>
